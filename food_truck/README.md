# Food-Truck-App

## Coming up with **"The Pitch"**
_What is the Food-Truck App?_
> It's a real-time way to easily find & share food trucks (and maybe some street food vendors) that are currently near your location. Think of it as a hybrid of Waze, gasbuddy and probably yelp.

_Who is the target market?_
> Anyone who is hungry, basically, but definitely foodies and street food enthusiasts.

### 1. Envision what the application should do and define a set of goals.

>- report/display coordinates of food trucks in the user's area
>- gives the hours of the food truck, like when they're leaving/closing (and arriving if we can scrape that all that necessary info)
>- Allow users to submit/confirm/correct a truck's location (and show this info too)
>- Display some details about each vendor's food offerings

### 2. Write a plan to determine the scripting language necessary, features that must be included, and set a time frame for events and tasks outlining the details of how the app should work.

### 3. Start building, testing and publish content for reviewal.

### 4. Test the support and stability of the application and focus on the removal of bugs, and network issues that would cause the application to fail.
